  "text": "We take the security of our community very seriously. Earlier this month, we became aware of unusual activity involving a third-party service provider. We immediately launched an investigation and outside security experts were engaged to assess what occurred. We were subsequently able to determine that an unauthorized third party accessed some DoorDash user data on May 4, 2019. We took immediate steps to block further access by the unauthorized third party and to enhance security across our platform. We are reaching out directly to affected users.\nWho was affected and what data was accessed?\nNot every user was affected. Approximately 4.9 million consumers, Dashers, and merchants who joined our platform on or before April 5, 2018, are affected. Users who joined after April 5, 2018 are not affected. The type of user data accessed could include:\n* Profile information including names, email addresses, delivery addresses, order history, phone numbers, as well as hashed, salted passwords — a form of rendering the actual password indecipherable to third parties.\n* For some consumers, the last four digits of consumer payment cards. However, full credit card information such as full payment card numbers or a CVV was not accessed. The information accessed is not sufficient to make fraudulent charges on your payment card.\n* For some Dashers and merchants, the last four digits of their bank account number. However, full bank account information was not accessed. The information accessed is not sufficient to make fraudulent withdrawals from your bank account.\n* For approximately 100,000 Dashers, their driver’s license numbers were also accessed.\nWhat steps has DoorDash taken?\nWe have taken a number of additional steps to further secure your data, which include adding additional protective security layers around the data, improving security protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside expertise to increase our ability to identify and repel threats.\nWhat should users do?\nWe are reaching out directly to affected users with specific information about what was accessed. We do not believe that user passwords have been compromised, but out of an abundance of caution, we are encouraging all of those affected to reset their passwords to one that is unique to DoorDash. You can change your DoorDash password by visiting https://www.doordash.com/accounts/password/reset/ and using the email address associated with your DoorDash account.\nWe deeply regret the frustration and inconvenience that this may cause you. Every member of the DoorDash community is important to us, and we want to assure you that we value your security and privacy. For further information, please see our FAQ page below. We’ve also set up a dedicated call center available 24/7 for support at 855–646–4683.\nSecurity Notice FAQ\nWhat happened?\nWe take the security of our community very seriously.
